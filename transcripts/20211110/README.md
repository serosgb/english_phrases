# TIME CHANGE and INTERNAL CLOCK

In this English lesson, I wanted to help you learn the English term **time change*. We just had time change this past weekend. Time change happens in countries that observe Daylight Savings Time. We have one time during the summer months, and then mid fall, we shift our clocks, and then we have a one-hour difference, and time change happens usually in the middle of the night between Saturday and Sunday. So this past weekend, we put our clocks back an hour. We ended up getting an extra hour's sleep. So time change is something that happens every fall and every spring. In the fall, we move our clocks back an hour. In the spring, we move them ahead an hour. That's actually worse because you kind of lose an hour. So this time change this past weekend was the lesser of two evils. That's how I would describe it because my internal clock is messed up.

The second phrase that we're looking at today or the second term is the term **internal clock**. We all use watches to tell time, but we also have an internal clock. We can kind of sense around what time it is, and right now, my internal clock is messed up. I'm making this video at around 3:30 in the afternoon on a Tuesday, and it feels like 4:30 to me. In a little while, it's going to get dark at about five o'clock, and that just seems way too early to me. So my internal clock is a little bit messed up, my sense of time that I naturally have in my head. I mean, I can't tell you exactly what time it is, but right now, it doesn't feel like 3:30 to me. It feels like around 4:30 or quarter to five. Anyways, my internal clock is messed up.

To review, this past weekend, we had what we call time change. There was time change this past weekend. So we switched our clocks, and now my internal clock is a little bit messed up. It takes about a week or two for my internal clock to adjust to the new time.

Anyways, let's look at a comment from a previous video. This comment is from Maria. I look forward to seeing your Christmas tree. It's so big, but be careful getting the ladder, Bob. You know accidents always happen close to home, and my response is I might have to buy a couple more strings of lights.

So yes, climbing up on a ladder can be a little bit dangerous, can't it? Whenever I work at heights, whenever I climb up a ladder, I'm usually extra careful. In fact, when I go really high on a ladder, I usually ask Jen to hold the ladder for me and vice versa. If Jen goes up on a ladder, usually, I will hold the ladder for her. Sometimes, we go up on the ladder to clean the eavestroughs on our house, the eavestroughs. I think they're called gutters in other countries. We call 'em eavestroughs. They get full of leaves, so sometimes I have to go up on a ladder to clean the eavestrough, and then Jen will hold the ladder so that the ladder doesn't slip while I'm at the very top of it.

But yes, that tree way back in the background... I'm not sure you could see it. Yeah, it's too close to the barn. It will eventually have Christmas lights on it, but I don't think I have enough strings of lights. I have some, but the tree, as I mentioned, keeps getting bigger, so I might have to go and buy a few more strings of lights, just so that I can get lights on the entire tree. That might cost a little bit of money, but I think it will definitely look really cool if I do that. So I'm pretty sure I will do that. I'll go to a store called Canadian Tire. That's a store that we go to in Canada to buy all sorts of things. Their slogan is more than just tires. It's actually like a big hardware store, kind of an outdoor store, kind of an everything store. So I might have to go to Canadian Tire and get a few more Christmas lights.

Anyways, thanks for watching this little English lesson. I'll see you in a couple of days with another one, bye.
