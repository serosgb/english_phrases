# LET SLEEPING DOGS LIE and DOG-TIRED

In this English lesson, I wanted to help you learn the English phrase, **let sleeping dogs lie**. This is a phrase we use to talk about a situation where there was a conflict or an argument, and it's now settled down, and there's a bit of peace. And then, if someone wants to start arguing again, we say, hey, it might be best right now to let sleeping dogs lie. If you're having a moment of peace, if two people are getting along, it might be a good idea to just let sleeping dogs lie. No need to start the argument again. No need to say something that annoys another person. No need to start to do things that are annoying when you have a little bit of peace. So, if you were fighting with someone, and you guys came to a resolution, and you weren't fighting anymore, and then if the other person wanted to start fighting again or arguing, you could say, hey, let's just let sleeping dogs lie, let's just enjoy this moment of peace.

The second phrase I wanted to teach you today is the phrase, **dog-tired**. I was hoping Oscar would be in this video, but he's running around over there right now, maybe we'll catch him later. When you're dog-tired, it means you're really, really tired. At the end of a long day's work, sometimes I'm dog tired. Sometimes I'm just really tired at the end of a long day. I'm gonna turn a little bit here. Oh, that's a little bit too bright, sorry. Oscar is out there, we'll see him in a bit.

Anyways, to review, when you say let sleeping dogs lie, it means that there was a conflict, and it has now ended, and if someone says something to start the conflict again, in order to tell them that you don't want them to, you say, hey, let's just let sleeping dogs lie. And if you are really, really tired, if you worked a long day, and you have done a lot of physical labor, you might say, oh, I'm just dog-tired right now. It's just a way of saying that you're really, really tired.

But hey, let's look at a comment from a previous video. This comment is from Qiu Park. The river level now is a bit lower than usual, right? It looks like a winter view already, appreciate your lesson. And my response was, yes, it is much lower. We were able to clean up the electric fence, and put away all our irrigation pipes. We're almost ready for the first snowfall here. Just a couple of more things to do.

So thanks, Qiu Park for that comment. Yes, the river, it's a little bright, and it's a little far away, but if you can see in the distance, the river is at a more normal level right now, and we're almost ready for winter. In a minute, you'll hear some crunching sounds, because if I spin you around, you'll see that there's no snow on the ground, but we do have ice. We have a little bit of ice on the puddles around here. It definitely went below zero last night.

I'm gonna walk this way, and see if we can see Oscar. Maybe I'll call him. Mm, whistling isn't working, because my lips are so cold. I'll try just calling them. Oscar, come here, pup. Come on! Come on, boy. Come on. When he gets here, he might be dog-tired. Come on, puppy, come on. Oh, he sees that I have the camera. He's not too happy about that. Oh, now he's running off to the house. Yup, Oscar has had his photograph taken a lot this year. My daughter started to do a little more photography, and one of her main subjects was Oscar. So he already didn't like the camera, because of me. And then because she was taking lots of pictures of him too, he learned to like the camera even less, or to hate the camera even more.

But anyways, yes, it's a little wintry out here. You can see. Ooh, that's bright. You can see all the trees have lost their leaves. We're just waiting for the first snowfall, which is probably gonna happen later this week. We'll see. It won't be too much. I still don't have my snowblower on, but anyways, thanks for watching. I'll see you in a couple days with another short English lesson, bye.
